# Sentence from words via API

## Task
The system will be a simple webapp exposing REST API acting as a generator of the sentences from the words inserted to 
it by rules described below. You can input any word to the system but you need to specify its part of speech - NOUN or VERB or ADJECTIVE.

The system must be able to generate a sentence from the words according to the rule that sentence is in the form of NOUN 
VERB ADJECTIVE. Further description of resources functionality is available in the next part - API proposal.

We suggest you use Spring Boot or Dropwizard but itâ€™s not mandatory. No persistence is needed -  persistent storage is 
only a bonus.

JSON format for API and library in unit tests:
  - https://github.com/lukas-krecan/JsonUnit
  
Integration tests:

If you find any nonsense in the task description or have a problem with bootstrapping the project in Spring Boot or 
Dropwizard feel free to ask at <jiri.sitina@gooddata.com>.
